        <div class="stanza" id="stanza1">
            Tiny shells that stick to stone,<br>
            Invisible invaders, never alone.
        </div>
        <div class="stanza" id="stanza2">
            A stowaway in the ballasts of ships is where they came,<br>
            Making humans sole to blame.<br>
            From the Caspian Sea to the Great Lakes, a distant trip,<br>
            Brought to the Great Lakes, enriched with nutrients, which would soon be stripped.
        </div>
        <div class="stanza" id="stanza3">
            The tiny traveler, Zebra mussels descend,<br>
            Into the deep blues where light ends.
        </div>
        <div class="stanza" id="stanza4">
            With no predators to contest,<br>
            They colonized rocks and spread.<br>
            They clung to the pylons, they smothered the sand,<br>
            Until the bottom lined with shells, no one would have planned.
        </div>
        <div class="stanza" id="stanza5">
            They filter the water, clear and clean,<br>
            A deceptive gift, not as good as it seems.<br>
            Stripping the waters with insatiable needs,<br>
            Disrupting the balance as native life pleads.
        </div>
        <div class="stanza" id="stanza6">
            Filtering plankton, the smallest of things,<br>
            They hollowed the food chain, unthreading its strings.<br>
            Native species outcompeted, imbalance it brings,<br>
            Zebra Mussels usurp native species, like a malevolent king.
        </div>
        <div class="stanza" id="stanza7">
            Water clear, but nutrients thinned,<br>
            They strangle out the life from within.<br>
            The mussels spread relentless and fast,<br>
            Zebra mussels now reign, their grip unsurpassed,<br>
            The Great Lakes forever changed, now a relic of their former past.
